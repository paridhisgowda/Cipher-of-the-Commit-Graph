# 🔐 Cipher of the Commit Graph

A mystery hides in the depths of this repository.  
Somewhere across its tangled history lies a secret that was never meant to be revealed.

## Objective

Uncover the hidden license key that lies scattered within the repository’s past.  
It is your task to explore, investigate, and reconstruct what was lost.

## Rules

- Do not modify the repository contents.  
- You may only use Git commands and reasoning to recover what’s hidden.  
- Collaboration is allowed, but sharing direct answers is not.

## Goal

Find the complete key.  
Prove your discovery by submitting the final, correct license string.
